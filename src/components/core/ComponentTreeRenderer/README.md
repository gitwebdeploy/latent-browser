# ComponentTreeRenderer

The component tree renderer is responsible for rendering a component tree generated by the LLM.

## Error tolerance

Note that due to the nature of LLMs, the renderer has to be robust to small errors and mistakes made by the language model.

### LLM using a component from the wrong scope

One of the most common error is the LLM trying to use a component from one namespace (eg. a PDF text block) in a completely different scope (eg. a WebGL scene).

In that case we try to find a equivalent in the correct scope

### LLM using an unknown node id

In that cas what we do is that we look for the closest component.
If we are withing a constrained scope, this search will be within the parent scope.
