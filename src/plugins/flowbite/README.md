# Flowbite

Plugin to use Flowbite components for UI components.

Note:
Flowbite has a fairly restrictive license, but I believe we are OK and that this is fair use.
I'm going to add a bunch of alternative plugins anyway, to give us some more open-source options to choose from.

The reason why I believe this is fair use is that in essence, the latent browser works like a classic website except content comes from the AI: it is meant for end users, not web developers.

It is not designed as a design-system, a toolkit or a library (it cannot be imported, it cannot generate React source files, it cannot "generate templates" etc). The target audience is thus not the same as Flowbite itself.
